Final Year Project â€“ Design and CFD analysis of a Quick Acting Valve for Shock Tunnel
Design of Quick Acting Valve for Shock Tunnel

This project focuses on the **design and optimization of a Quick Acting Valve (QAV)** for a shock tunnel setup, developed as part of my Aeronautical Engineering final-year project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To design and optimize a quick-acting valve system that ensures minimal response time and reliable performance during high-pressure shock tunnel experiments.

## ðŸ§  Key Areas
- Aerodynamics and compressible flow analysis  
- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations  
- Valve geometry optimization  
- Manufacturing feasibility and material selection  

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- ANSYS Fluent for CFD  
- Creo for Design  

## ðŸ“Š Results 
- Improved flow efficiency with optimized geometry  
- Provided design recommendations for experimental testing  

ðŸ’¡ *This project combines engineering design, data analysis, and CFD â€” aligning with aerospace system optimization and applied data visualization.*
